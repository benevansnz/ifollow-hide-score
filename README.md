1. Download an extension for your browser which allows you to use custom JavaScript on the website, e.g.

- Google Chrome: [Custom JavaScript for Websites 2](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/ddbjnfjiigjmcpcpkmhogomapikjbjdkfi)
- Firefox: [Code Injector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codeinjector/)

2. Go to the club website, any page will do e.g. [swfc.co.uk/accessibility](https://www.swfc.co.uk/accessibility/) (this will avoid any current game spoilers)
3. Copy the contents of [this file](https://github.com/benevansnz/ifollow-hide-score/blob/main/index.js) into your extension
4. Make sure you've saved it, if required. Refresh the page, and then return to the main page of the website e.g. [swfc.co.uk](https://www.swfc.co.uk/)

NOTE: In the case of the Chrome recommendation I've recommended, you may need to start off by selecting **New RegExp** in the extension, and entering the following:
- *.swfc.co.uk
