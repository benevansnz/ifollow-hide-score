I can't vouch for the following extensions, but I have verified that the javascript within this repository works when used with the folowing:

- Google Chrome, add the following extension: Custom JavaScript for Websites 2
- Firefox, add the following extension: Code Injector

Within the given extension on the swfc.co.uk site paste the contents of this file (the above lines are fine too - they're not interpreted by the browser)
